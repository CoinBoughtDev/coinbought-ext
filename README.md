# CoinBought Extension

- CoinBought allows you to buy anything off of Amazon with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Bitcoin Cash and more!
- The CoinBought extension makes it easy by automatically adding everything from your Amazon cart to your CoinBought cart!

## Installing

You can install the extension from the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coinbought/egfgfjgkhcmocpjflngjkbbgelledkbg).

## Building

1. Clone project

2. Run `npm install`

3. Run `build.sh`. This will build the JS which will end up in the ext folder. There is also `watch.sh` which will automatically rebuild when a JS file changes.

4. Add the ext folder to chrome as an "unpacked extension"
