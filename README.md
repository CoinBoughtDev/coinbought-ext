# coinbought - Buy anything off of Amazon with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Bitcoin Cash and more!

To get started:

1. Clone project
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `build.sh`. This will build the JS which will end up in the ext folder. There is also `watch.sh` which will automatically rebuild when a JS file changes.
4. Add the ext folder to chrome as an "unpacked extension"
